# Singly Linked List Operations  

## 📌 Introduction  
A **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers.  
Each node contains two parts:  
1. **Data** → The actual value stored in the node.  
2. **Next** → A pointer to the next node in the sequence.  

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store data in contiguous memory locations.  

Common real-life examples:  
- Playlist navigation in music apps.  
- Image slideshow viewers.  
- Navigation through browser history.

## ⚙️ Basic Operations  
1. **Insertion** → Add a new node at the beginning, end, or a given position.  
2. **Deletion** → Remove a node from the beginning, end, or a given position.  
3. **Traversal** → Visit all nodes sequentially.  
4. **Search** → Find an element in the list.  
5. **Update** → Modify the data of a given node.
